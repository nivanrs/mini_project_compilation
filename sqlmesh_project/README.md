# SQLMesh Mini Project

This example demonstrates a minimal [SQLMesh](https://www.tobikodata.com/sqlmesh) project using a local DuckDB database.

It was created using `sqlmesh init duckdb` and contains sample models and tests.

Run the following commands to execute the models:

```bash
cd sqlmesh_project
sqlmesh run
```

This will build the models defined in the `models/` folder using the configuration in `config.yaml`.
